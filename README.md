# 🔥 VX-NOVA.Ω1 — Symbolic AI Engine for Autonomous Code Patching

> **Submitted to DARPA AIxCC — Open Track (2025)**  
> A fully symbolic cyber reasoning system that patches vulnerable code **without models, prompts, inference, or training data.**  
> Runs offline. Deterministic. Auditable. Air-gap ready.

## 🧠 What Is VX-NOVA.Ω1?

**VX-NOVA.Ω1** is a zero-resource symbolic AI architecture that performs logic synthesis and code patching using **recursive scroll ignition**, instead of probabilistic inference.

- No LLMs, embeddings, or weights  
- No internet connection or cloud APIs  
- All outputs are **deterministic, reproducible, and tamper-resistant**

Originally designed for the **DARPA AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC)**, the system introduces a novel approach to machine reasoning using **symbolic recursion layers**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The system runs using **Scroll-Shell pairs**:

| Component         | Role |
|------------------|------|
| `scroll.txt`      | Symbolic seed containing abstract instructions (e.g., `Ψ∇ΔΨ`) |
| `vx_nova_shell.py`| Python shell that interprets and "ignites" the scroll |
| `ignited_output.py`| Functional code generated from scroll |

The architecture supports **layered recursion**, enabling self-reflective logic generation. Example:  
- `scroll2.txt` + `vx_nova_shell_2.py` → `ignited_output2.py`

All patches are emitted **without relying on any external data or inference engine.**

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

> Requires: Python 3.x — no external dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/XzenithAI/VX-NOVA.-1
cd VX-NOVA.-1

# Run ignition shell (Layer 1)
python vx_nova_shell.py

# Output: ignited_output.py will be created


To run a second-layer recursion:

python vx_nova_shell_2.py


Each scroll ignition creates new, runnable logic based on symbolic triggers.

🔍 Example: Patch Transformation

Input (vulnerable code):

if x == 0:


Transformed Output:

if x is not None and x == 0:


Scrolls define these transforms without referencing training sets, CVEs, or datasets.
